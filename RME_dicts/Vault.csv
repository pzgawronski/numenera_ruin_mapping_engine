1,"Stacks of metallic disc-shaped oddities that avoid being touched by anything organic, sliding away if possible (grabbing one by hand is a difficulty 3 task)."
2,"Four fluid-filled canisters each hold what seems to be a human spine grafted with metallic wires and modules. If some method is found for replacing a character's spine with one of the spines in a canister (and if the character survives), that PC would gain an ability determined randomly using the Artifacts Table in the corebook."
3,"Black synth card on a pedestal. If found in the Jade Colossus, the card grants the user an asset on a task related to dealing with a relic, including resisting dangerous effects, avoiding attacks from creatures touched by a relic or that are infused with void matter, or understanding or using a relic. If found in another installation, the card grants access to a key area in the ruin."
4,"Level 8 artifact vehicle capable of travel through space. The vault contains a mechanism allowing the vehicle to be deployed to the surface of the installation, where it can launch. It requires a crew of two to four, and can carry up to ten more people or some cargo. It can sustain passengers for up to three months before it needs to return to a planet with a breathable atmosphere. It can travel to locations within the solar system known to the pilot in a few days, or between known distant interstellar locations in about a month. Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check per day of use)."
5,"Solid black cube about the size of a human fist encased in a larger clear cube (a level 10 cypher). When the cypher is activated, the clear cube begins to dissolve, which takes ten minutes. After the outer cube dissolves fully, the black cube causes all living creatures in long range that are larger than a small dog to belch forth a cloud of black vapor. This vapor fills the immediate area around the victim, inflicting 10 points of damage to the victim and all other living creatures within the cloud. One round later, all living creatures larger than a small dog within long range of every affected victim belch forth the same cloud (even if they already did so before). This continues until no creatures are affected. The cypher is a horrific doomsday device that could easily destroy an entire city or wipe out an army."
6,"Canister of four level 7 pellets in a mechanical case, each of which shimmers as if on the edge of disappearing. If a pellet is swallowed, mass is drawn to the user from another dimension, allowing them to grow 200 percent larger for one day. During this time, the user gains 12 points to their Might Pool and deals +8 points of damage with all melee attacks, but all Speed-related tasks, including defense, are two steps more difficult. In addition, moving through small spaces could become a challenge."
7,"Humanlike head, but 50% larger than normal, preserved in a metallic device with a crystal face. The head may have been alive once or served as a tap into the datasphere, but some sort of error has rendered it so much numenera-suffused preserved flesh."
8,"Canister of four level 8 pellets in a mechanical case, each of which is almost ten times heavier than a similar-sized piece of iron. If a pellet is swallowed, the user is transmuted into dull grey metal. The user has entered a safe suspended animation that lasts for 28 hours. While suspended, the user is impervious to attacks lower than level 8."
9,"Vault is actually a vehicle that moves around the interior of the installation on lines of magnetic force, using a system of accessways built for it and similar movable chambers. Figuring out how to engage the vehicle is a level 5 Intellect task. However, it moves somewhat violently, and anyone not secured risks suffering 4 points of Might damage from the sudden starts, turns, and stops. The vehicle apparently has a variable number of preset destinations. Where it actually goes when activated seems to be random, though someone who spends a few weeks experimenting might figure out how to use it reliably."
10,Razor-thin metallic webs fill the vault. Moving through requires a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll to avoid suffering 4 points of damage per immediate distance crossed. Three level 5 automatons with spiderlike legs move to attack anyone that comes into the vault.
11,"Mechanized vat containing an active nano-fluid. A mechanical crane can be used to douse objects or creatures in the vat (a level 4 Intellect task). Someone who succeeds on a level 6 Intellect task can confer a doused object or creature with +2 to Armor (in the form of a more resilient, damage-resistant outer surface) that lasts for 28 hours. However, a mishap with the vat seals the object or creature inside a level 6 caul that renders an object unusable or smothers a creature unless the caul can be removed."
12,"This complex level 8 device is a rectangular obelisk twice as tall as a human, covered in screens, mechanisms, and controls. It's surrounded by a force-field globe (Armor 10), which must be dealt with to reach the device. The obelisk doesn't have an obvious purpose, so unless the GM has a need for a complex control device, it is good for little more than being a rich source of numenera salvage."
13,"Stack of three red synth cards in a clear vessel. Each card, called a flaying key, is an artifact (depletion: 1in 1d10) useful for conducting surgical procedures. A touched target's skin disappears and the card adheres to the target, moving the target one step down the damage track. While skin is absent, the difficulty of any task related to curing the target's disease, ameliorating poison, mending broken bones, or other radical healing requiring surgery is reduced by two steps. The target's skin returns when the key is removed, moving the target one step up the damage track."
14,"Level 8 transparent sphere has a diameter of 30 feet (9 m) but contains an area far larger than its size would seem to indicate. In this area, visible but as if through haze, is an ancient city of silver towers, permanently preserved and deserted. (Essentially, this is an entirely new prior-world installation, which could be explored if the level 8 sphere could be breached.)"
15,"Tomb of a 30-foot (9 m) tall humanoid creature wearing some kind of mechanized armor. The entity is dead and mummified, but its equipment could be salvaged."
16,"Metallic level 8 artifact helmet contained in a clear glass case (depletion: 1 in1d6). This synthsteel helmet has eight strange projections. If activated when worn (a level g Intellect task), eight 9-foot (3 m) long tentacles emerge from the device and remain for up to ten minutes. The tentacles are translucent, modulating between phase states. They can be used to pick up or manipulate objects, push buttons, and so forth, or to attack every creature within immediate range of the user for 8 points of damage. The tentacles can move through energy fields, including solid force fields, as if they were not there."
17,"Complex level 7 machine with many glass reservoirs filled with different weird fluids. Manipulator arms are poised to grasp anything that stands on an activation plate. If any kind of organic material (including a living creature) steps or is placed onto the plate, the arms attempt to grasp it (a level 4 attack) and insert it into an opening at the machine's top. Ingested objects are broken down into their essential materials and stored as various complex fluids. Someone standing at the machine's controls who succeeds on a level 7 Intellect task could reconstitute an ingested living creature, or try to make a new creature from the materials gathered."
18,"What appears to be an ornate mirror hangs on a pedestal within a clear synth dome. Examination of the “mirror” reveals that it's a vertical sheet of reflective liquid and touching it causes ripples. The sheet is a level 8 numenera artifact (depletion: 1 in 1d20) that can transfer someone who steps into the mirror to another dimension or level of reality. The user must know that the destination they seek exists; the GM decides if the user has enough information to confirm its existence and the level of difficulty needed to reach it. Otherwise, the user merely walks back out of the liquid surface of the mirror."
19,"Immobile device with leaflike arms partly enfolds a glowing spherical ball of transdimensional energy. This level 7 artifact (depletion: 1 in 1d10) transforms a user who succeeds on a difficulty 5 Intellect task into an immaterial energy construct for up to one hour, during which time the user can’t affect or be affected by normal matter or energy, except as follows. The user can attack a target within long range, inflicting 7 points of transdimensional energy damage; the attack returns the user to normal. Alternatively, the device can be used to recharge a depleted artifact."
20,"Vortex of energy swirls above a raised circular platform surrounded by complex machinery. Its radiance makes it difficult to look at, and its heat makes it difficult to stand near. High-intensity energy in the area induces a feeling of awe in observers. The vortex is a wormhole that leads directly into the sun."
