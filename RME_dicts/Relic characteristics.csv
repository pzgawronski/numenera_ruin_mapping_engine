1,"Intuition. Characters who spend a few minutes in the vicinity of the relic gain insight into a problem they've tried but failed to solve before. An answer comes to them unbidden, one that might prove the perfect solution."
2,Strength. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity find the difficulty of any Might task reduced by three steps. This strength shift lasts for 28 hours.
3,"Insinuation. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity can vault their minds into another creature's body within short range as a level 7 Intellect attack. If successful, the attacking character controls the target body for up to 28 hours while their own body remains in a deep sleep."
4,Expertise. Characters who spend several hours in the relics vicinity find the difficulty of any Intellect task reduced by three steps. This strength shift lasts for 28 hours.
5,"Void Manipulation. Characters who spend a few minutes in the relic’s vicinity can extrude streamers of void matter for one minute at a time, increasing their normal reach from immediate range to short. Anything a character could do with their own hands, they can do at range through void manipulation. This ability persists for one hour."
6,"Void Strike. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity can extrude a ray of void matter at a target within short range, inflicting 5 points of damage that ignores Armor. This ability persists for 28 hours."
7,"Ancillary Anatomy. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain a secondary companion intelligence that takes the form of a vestigial limb or organ, similar to the relic, which remains attached to the character. Affected characters can treat the ancillary anatomy as a level 2 NPC that might provide aid, depending on the nature of the organ. For instance, an additional nose would grant an asset on perception tasks, but an extra foot might provide an inability in most movement tasks (but perhaps an asset on tasks to retain balance and stability). The vestigial anatomy persists for up to 28 hours."
8,Communication. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain long-range telepathy that lasts for 28 hours.
9,Discernment. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity always know when another creature is telling a lie. This ability persists for 28 hours.
10,"Resistance. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain +2 to Armor and the ability to withstand poisons, venoms, and diseases of level 8 and lower for the next 28 hours."
11,Persistence. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to breathe in any atmosphere or in water. They can hold their breath for several hours without coming to harm in a vacuum. This ability persists for 28 hours.
12,"Creation. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to mold other creatures’ flesh as if it were clay. For targets that resist, using this ability is a physical attack. Molding another creature could provide them with wings, an extra limb, an extra eye, and so on, though someone with malign intent could remove a creature's eyes, pull off a limb, and so on. The GM will determine benefits or damage inflicted (or both) depending on the result. In any case, a character trying to mold the flesh of another must succeed on a difficulty 4 Intellect task (or higher, if attempting something complicated like adding functional wings) or suffer a negative mishap. This ability lasts for one hour, but the effects created by the ability are permanent."
13,"Aggressive Destiny. Characters who spend several hours in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to harm another creature with certainty. When the character attacks a target with an ability, weapon, or device, regardless of the range or any barriers separating them, the attack succeeds (treat as a routine task). The user can attack any target, but only if they know that the target exists; the GM will decide if they have enough information to confirm the target's existence. This ability lasts for one minute, or until a target that isn’t in the same chamber is attacked."
14,"Healer. Characters who spend several days in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to touch a target and restore its Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their maximum values, as if it were fully rested. A single target can benefit from this ability only once each day. This ability lasts for 28 hours."
15,"Spiritual Leader. Characters who spend several days in the relic's vicinity gain the ability to convert another creature (whose level is less than their own) to service and sacrifice. The target gives up whatever occupation and life it previously pursued to become the character's follower. It continues to serve the character gladly, unless or until the character does wrong by the target, as determined by the GM. This ability lasts until used."
16,"Far Treader. Characters who spend several days in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to step between distant locations as easily as they might step into the next room. When using this ability, a character can move between locations no matter how far apart they are, as long as they have been to that location previously or can see it. This ability lasts for one hour."
17,"Invincible. Characters who spend several weeks in the relic’s vicinity gain +10 to Armor and the ability to withstand poisons, venoms, and diseases of level 10 and lower for the next hour."
18,"Foldable. Characters who spend several days in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to fold themselves into much smaller spaces, including tiny cracks, or to inflate their mass by as much as 1,000% as long as there is space to do so. Each halving or increase by 50% in size requires one full round of effort. This ability lasts for 28 hours."
19,"Contemplative. Characters who spend a few minutes in the relic’s vicinity remember something they failed to note the first time around, perhaps a minor detail that seemed insignificant, but which on further thought emerges as a clue. If nothing in the characters’ history suits, instead they gain +1 to Intellect Edge for one hour."
20,"Communion Enabler. Characters who spend several weeks in the relic’s vicinity gain the ability to speak telepathically with all creatures in a 2-mile (3 km) radius simultaneously, regardless of differences in language or physical barriers, for a few rounds. Though the effect is potentially overwhelming for those few rounds, the follow-on effect allows all connected creatures to gain a brief sense of each other and each other's point of view. For the next ten days at least, the difficulty of any positive interaction tasks attempted between affected creatures is reduced by three steps. The ability to enter into this communion lasts until used."
