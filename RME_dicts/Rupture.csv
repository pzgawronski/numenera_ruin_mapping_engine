1,Empty of all but drit.
2,"Area (and potentially a few surrounding corridors) is filled with an orange-red mist that confuses the senses and turns around creatures who enter the space (a level 6 effect) so that when they think they are leaving the area in a known direction, they're actually leaving and moving in a random direction."
3,"Tiny metallic insects crawl everywhere; the insects are essentially harmless (level 1) but tend to get into clothing, hair, and bags and packs."
4,"Area through which the rupture passes was once a vault; roll on the Vault Table to determine the ruined, inactive remains that are scattered through this area."
5,"Tiny amoeba-like creatures the color of [eaves drip and flow around the area; they carry a parasite, and living creatures that enter the area risk contracting a mind-enhancing sickness (a disease) that heightens their mental capacities even as it kills them."
6,Crater glowing with residual radiation inflicts 1 point of ambient damage on each creature in the area each minute they spend in the rupture.
7,"If near the perimeter of the installation, the rupture extends to the outside and could serve as a new entrance/exit to the ruin."
8,Water flows swiftly through the rupture from a higher location before plunging in a dramatic fashion to a deeper location 1d10 x 100 feet (30 m) lower in an interstitial cavity; roll on the Interstitial Cavity Table.
9,Oddly whorled fungi cover the interior; some of the growths are taller than people.
10,"Oddly whorled fungi cover the interior; some of the growths are taller than people. The fungi exude soporific spores, putting to sleep anyone who fails a difficulty 5 Might defense task."
11,"Synth “grass” the color of milk grows in rough patches here and there, rustling slowly."
12,""Synth “grass” the color of milk grows in rough patches here and there, rustling slowly. The “grass” holds in place anyone who fails a difficulty 5 Might defense task."
13,"Something has been storing skeletons of dead creatures, automatons, and explorers in this rupture, organizing the bones in neat, stacked rows."
14,"A waxy, slightly cool-to-the touch ooze pools, drips, and undulates here and there about the rupture."
15,"Stone “grows” through relatively quick crystallization in the rupture, forming geometric crystalline spires."
16,A creature* lairs here; roll again on this table to determine the nature of the rupture; the creature is immune to any negative effects.
17,"Resin-like whorled secretions cover the area, apparently laid down over months or years by some kind of creature or biological process."
18,"Slender, translucent organic strands hang down from whatever serves as the ceiling, filling the area so thickly that it's impossible to move through without brushing the strands aside. The strands “sweat” a weak acid that inflicts 2 points of ambient damage each round a creature remains in or moves through the area."
19,"Metal interior is twisted, warped, bent, and in some cases transformed into other substances; a scholar of the numenera might suspect that the Iron Wind caused the damage."
20,"Metal interior is twisted, warped, bent, and in some cases transformed into other substances; a scholar of the numenera might suspect that the Iron Wind caused the damage, but a seed of the Iron Wind is still present and could be roused if disturbed."
