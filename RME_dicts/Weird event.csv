1,Quake accompanied by blue haze and high-pitched musical tones goes on for almost a minute. Creatures must succeed on Speed defense tasks or suffer 5 points of damage from being knocked around.
2,"Vague smell slowly sharpens, assaulting every creature in the area with an odor so indescribably delicious that they salivate in uncontrollable yearning. The odor fades after a minute, but the hunger awakened is so strong that it dazes creatures, increasing the difficulty of all tasks by one step, until they can enjoy a large meal."
3,"Low, thrumming hum impinges on the senses of one-third of any group of creatures in the area. To those who can sense it, the humming is intense and hard to ignore. To the rest, nothing is detected or sensed. The humming dies away after a few minutes."
4,"Swarm of thousands of tiny red insects covers the walls, floors, and ceilings, moving an immediate distance each round. They produce a rich, vibrating sound audible for miles. The insects are harmless individually, though potentially capable of smothering a creature that falls prone in their path."
5,"Everyone hears a voice in their heads in a language that isn't known. The voice seems to be making some kind of announcement that lasts a couple of rounds. If the PCs have a translation device that allows them to understand an unknown language, the words seem to be stern instructions, but without the proper knowledge and context, they are still inexplicable."
6,"Time wave washes through the area, though characters may not realize its full effect until they finally emerge from the installation to discover they were inside two months longer than they thought."
7,"Time wave washes through the area, though characters may not realize its full effect until they finally emerge from the structure two months earlier than when they entered."
8,"Brilliant flash of light leaves in its wake small changes to reality in the vicinity, which characters might notice, such as a cloak color being different, a tattoo design being reversed, and so on. However, a large change, such as the addition of a new compatriot who believes they've always been part of the group, is possible."
9,"Brilliant flash of light leaves in its wake a completely altered situation. Instead of exploring the interior of an installation, the characters find themselves clinging to the shell of a vast structure floating in airless void, with huge chunks of what might be the Earth spiraling around them in a planetary cloud. Stutters of other flashing alternative realities encompass the PCs before they expire in the vacuum, returning them to their original situation and reality."
10,"Stampede of phase-shifted creatures with milky fur, limbs dozens of feet long, and voices like children runs through the area, passing through objects, normal creatures, characters, and walls as if those objects were not there. Once past, they leave behind a slightly doglike scent that quickly fades."
11,"Flying vessel impacts the exterior of the installation with so much force, the walls are cracked and the vessel is mostly destroyed. The vessel contains several creatures* who, maddened and injured, spill out into nearby corridors."
12,"The temperature begins to drop, slowly and barely perceptible at first. But within a few hours, it drops far below freezing and stays that way within a large area for several hours, until the effect passes and normal conditions reassert themselves."
13,"Spatial anomaly manifests as a sparkling hole in space. The one-way anomaly persists for several days, during which time it constantly spits out random objects, which are often broken or fused pieces of tech, but sometimes include contemporary objects of the Ninth World such as shoes, hats, and human body parts."
14,"Dozens of previously undetected compartments iris open, from which a small fleet of fist-sized level 1 automatons emerge. The automatons skim along surfaces, leaving in their path a thin veneer of level 2 synth. If several automatons are caught and salvaged, a few cyphers might be gained."
15,"Rumbling and shaking presages a flood of viscous brown fluid moving a short distance each round, spreading out to fill several connected corridors and chambers, potentially drowning any creature caught in its path. The fluid is somewhat nutritious, sweet, and sticky. It subsides and drains away over the course of a day."
16,"Tech in the characters’ possession designed to provide directions or information – including cyphers, artifacts, or oddities—spontaneously activates. Otherwise, one handheld device owned by a character, regardless of its function, activates with a previously unknown function that shows a representation of the PCs’ location and a pointer indicating that they should follow a route through a hidden passage they'd not previously discovered. If they follow this weird prompt, they discover a shaft plunging down for several miles, at the bottom of which is an abhuman colony (roll on the Abhuman Colony Table). All the abhumans have been murdered as if hit by something large and fast moving. And that something (a level 6 creature of the GM's choosing) now hunts the PCs."
17,"Handheld device owned by a character, regardless of its function, activates with a previously unknown function that opens communication with a voice that speaks a language the PC knows. The voice is in trouble and asks for help, indicating that some kind of terrible disaster has befallen, and only they are left. It should become clear soon enough that the voice is the character's own, but the apocalyptic events hinted at have not happened—at least, not in this reality, or maybe not yet."
18,"All tech, devices, and automatons in the area of level 7 or lower spontaneously power down for several minutes. During the dead span, weird shadows flow and stream over all nearby surfaces, never quite resolving enough to determine their shape. When the shadows fade, items suddenly return to full function. Automatons have no memory of their function outage."
19,Void matter storm passes through the area; treat each affected creature as if they used a midnight stone.
20,"Golden haze springs up out of nowhere, filling an area that includes many connected chambers and corridors for one hour. Creatures in the haze feel light-headed, happy, and at ease. Grudges are easier to let go, and long-held prejudices without factual basis can be judged for the chimeras of thought that they truly are. For one golden hour, clear-thinking rationality shines through, revealing what passes for normal human thought to be a series of mistakes in thinking that people generally ignore or explain away."
