3,"Empty and echoing, but contains vast outlines of what must have been immense machines or machine components that have since been removed."
5,"Empty and echoing, but contains vast outlines of what must have been immense machines or machine components that have since been removed, except slender trees with black bark have sprung up in a soft layer of drit and dust."
7,"Empty and echoing, but contains vast outlines of what must have been immense machines or machine components that have since been removed, except spiders, worms, and similar vermin are thick in the area, infesting a few large masses that turn out to be the bones of long-dead creatures that were very, very large."
9,"Empty and echoing, but contains vast outlines of what must have been immense machines or machine components that have since been removed, except one of the outlines seems like it might have been of a massive human shape."
11,"Filled with immense, dead, corroded, long-silent machine components fused to interior. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast dead engines can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet)."
13,"Filled with immense, dead, corroded, long-silent machine components fused to interior. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast dead engines can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), but contains a lair for a creature."
15,"Filled with immense, dead, corroded, long-silent machine components fused to interior. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast dead engines can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), but the footing is far more dangerous due to a slick of oil-like fluid coating everything; moving safely around the chamber and avoiding falling requires a successful level 5 Speed defense task."
17,"Filled with immense, dead, corroded, long-silent machine components fused to interior. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast dead engines can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), but a strange rust covers the mechanism and acts like a contact poison."
19,"Filled with immense, dead, corroded, long-silent machine components fused to interior. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast dead engines can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), but several dead humans lie at the foot of the great machines. Investigation reveals they've been looted, but also that some of them have had their faces flayed off and sewn back on again with synth thread."
21,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction."

Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction; however, characters who spend a few hours studying the machines might discover that they could be induced to attach a massive (house-sized) device capable of creating an amazing amount of thrust, enough to potentially launch the object into space or even farther."
25,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction; however, characters who spend a few hours studying the machines might discover that they could be induced to suck all the metal out of a very large object and deliver a metallic ingot of the stolen metals. The process inflicts 10 points of damage to a living creature and causes them to descend one step on the damage track."
27,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction; however, characters who spend a few hours studying the machines might discover that they could be induced to extrude massive (house-sized) crystal solids that glimmer internally but have no obvious purpose."
29,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction; however, characters who spend a few hours studying the machines might discover that they could be induced to plate an arbitrarily large object with a level 4 synth coating that grants +4 to Armor (the process would kill human-sized creatures, essentially encasing them in a chunk of solid synth)."
31,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction, but roll on the Integrated Machine Table to see what these machines might do. However, the ones found in an interstitial cavity would create the stated effect on a far grander scale, which means effects that might normally enhance or aid a human-sized creature will instead probably kill them."
33,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. The components whir, vibrate, and give off a constant bass roar that is difficult to endure over long periods. Each character who spends several hours clambering over the vast degraded devices can find one or two cyphers and 1d20 shins, but must succeed on one level 3 Speed defense task to avoid slipping and falling from a great height (d100 feet), and one level 3 Intellect task to avoid causing a local malfunction, but an entity has previously entered the chamber and scribed in a silvery metallic ink across the machine surfaces what are essentially “margin notes” to help those new to the area figure out what the vast machines might do."
35,"Filled with tumbling components and machine parts 10 feet (3 m) to a side, apparently once fused to the walls but now weightless and dead, that crash and batter each other. Each long distance moved through the chamber requires a successful level 5 Speed defense task to avoid being battered for 5 points of damage."
37,"Half filled with fluid from an ancient leak. Roll on the Matter Leak Table to determine the nature of the reservoir-sized spill. Opening the wrong exit could cause the fluid to leak into other sections of the ruin, causing flooding and dangerous conditions, depending on the nature of the material."
39,"Vast machinery holds in place a massive sphere at the center of the cavity. The sphere is a planet, which, though small, is still much too large to be contained in the cavity. But thanks to the enclosing machinery that folds space, the planet is indeed held in place. About two-thirds the size of Earth, the strange planet is swaddled in red clouds and storms. Characters who attempt to access the planet's surface find it habitable, but incredibly unstable. Volcanoes and earthquakes are common, but plant life is lush, though there don’t seem to be any animals or other ambulatory creatures, or in fact any sign of previous habitation. If anything did live here once, the constant upheaval on the surface likely recycled them deep into the planet's core long ago."
41,"High, narrow towers made of what appears to be dark red glass jut from the sides and floor (and hang from the ceiling) of this space. The towers have no doors, but sometimes spontaneously absorb those looking to enter, freezing them in stasis."
43,"High, narrow towers made of what appears to be dark red glass jut from the sides and floor (and hang from the ceiling) of this space. The towers have no doors, but sometimes spontaneously absorb those looking to enter, freezing them in stasis, but the towers are hollow, and one serves as the home or lair to at least one creature."
45,"Metallic pyramids of all sizes, some as small as a thumbnail, others as tall as buildings, are jumbled in this space."
47,"Metallic pyramids of all sizes, some as small as a thumbnail, others as tall as buildings, are jumbled in this space, but the pyramids are magnetized, so automatons and creatures with metal armor stick to exposed surfaces; some dead automatons and a few explorers who couldn't get their armor off can be found here."
49,"The space is occupied by an odd ecosystem of purple plants, tiny red clouds, and small, singing, gopher-like creatures with two heads."
51,Blotches of green and yellow color move like the shadows of clouds across the empty surfaces of this large space.
53,"Blotches of green and yellow color move like the shadows of clouds across the empty surfaces of this large space, but the color “shadows” are attracted to motion and attack creatures by “staining” and then eating their substance, converting them into yet more color."
55,"A massive crystalline object floats at the center of this cavity, slowly rotating, held in place by an unseen force."
57,"A massive crystalline object floats at the center of this cavity, slowly rotating, held in place by an unseen force, but if light is directed on the crystal, the light is broken into all the colors of the rainbow and more; two of the colors are not normally possible in this dimension, and creatures that see them or that are bathed in their light risk temporary insanity."
59,"A massive crystalline object floats at the center of this cavity, slowly rotating, held in place by an unseen force, but the head of a massive, multi-eyed creature that isn't completely humanoid is preserved in the crystal."
61,"Broken conduits drizzle the exposed areas of the space with a yellowish, sap-like substance that has formed stalagmites and stalactites over hundreds of years; the sap is sweet to the taste and nutritious."
63,"This space is apparently where some kind of creature has stored trophies for hundreds of years—trophies in the form of teeth, which lie in cascading piles across the cavity. The creature responsible is not immediately evident."
65,"A broken, partly smashed vehicle capable of traveling into the void lies in—or has been somehow wedged into—this cavity. With enough time and effort, the ship might be able to be repaired, but getting it out of the cavity is another problem."
67,Waves of energy flow back and forth across this room like heat mirages over a hard surface on a hot day. The energy ruffles hair and clothing but doesn’t seem directly harmful.
69,"Waves of energy flow back and forth across this room like heat mirages over a hard surface on a hot day. The energy ruffles hair and clothing but doesn’t seem directly harmful, but devices of the numenera (cyphers, artifacts, and oddities) begin to glow brighter and brighter when exposed to the energy. Devices that remain exposed for more than three rounds detonate."
71,"Waves of energy flow back and forth across this room like heat mirages over a hard surface on a hot day. The energy ruffles hair and clothing but doesn’t seem directly harmful, but with each wave, a mental surge of thousands of whispering voices intrudes on the minds of conscious creatures in the area."
73,"Waves of energy flow back and forth across this room like heat mirages over a hard surface on a hot day. The energy ruffles hair and clothing but doesn’t seem directly harmful, but creatures in the area risk having their minds randomly switched. This can be especially disconcerting for characters whose minds get switched with a creature* that follows them into the area."
75,"Refugees from a nearby village of humans overrun by creatures* hide in this chamber, living off the by-products of a large machine that produces tasteless but nutritious brown goo."
77,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. Broken devices emit sprays of pollen-like dust that changes the center of gravity of creatures and objects it touches, making it difficult for creatures to walk or run without tipping over."
79,"Filled with immense, partially functioning, colossal machine components fused to walls and ceiling high above. Broken devices emit sprays of white mist that acts as poison to living creatures, but which coats automatons in a layer of protective coating granting +1 to Armor."
81,"The air in this chamber is hazed with narrow vortices that move randomly about, sometimes spinning apart, other times spinning back together again. The vortices spin away from creatures and moving objects."
83,"The air in this chamber is hazed with narrow vortices that move randomly about, sometimes spinning apart, other times spinning back together again. The vortices spin away from creatures and moving objects, but the vortices represent splinter personalities of a machine intelligence that once inhabited this area. Individual vortices can speak by vibrating the air, but each has a very narrow slice of knowledge or specialty."
85,"The air in this chamber is hazed with narrow vortices that move randomly about, sometimes spinning apart, other times spinning back together again. The vortices spin away from creatures and moving objects, but each vortex is a level 4 threat; 1d6 of them zero in on any group of creatures trying to make their way across the cavity."
87,A lens dozens of feet across composed of clear synth has been crudely installed here; it focuses sunlight that sometimes shines in from cracks above onto a device that hums and vibrates when in bright light.
89,"A lens dozens of feet across composed of clear synth has been crudely installed here; it focuses sunlight that sometimes shines in from cracks above onto a device that hums and vibrates when in bright light, except the lens wakes for the span of time the beam is focused fully on it (about two minutes), during which time it serves as a terminal into the datasphere."
91,Discharges of electricity play throughout this chamber like some kind of cloud-wreathed hellscape of danger.
93,"The holographic image of a gargantuan eye flickers into existence in the cavity, blinking and focusing on intruders before fading again for a random period. Devices in the area are found to project this image, as well as have many other functions that are less easy to identify."
95,"Massive metallic ring dominates the cavity, cracked and possibly unstable. The ring magnetically holds a brilliant sphere of glowing white material at the center."
97,"Massive metallic ring dominates the cavity, cracked and possibly unstable. The ring magnetically holds a brilliant sphere of glowing white material at the center, but the sphere at the center pulses in a variety of rhythms when creatures enter the area. The pulsing is actually communication from beings who exist in two dimensions and are curious about the dimension of the Ninth World."
99,"Massive metallic ring dominates the cavity, cracked and possibly unstable. The ring magnetically holds a brilliant sphere of glowing white material at the center, but the sphere represents stored, massively compacted waste. Any object or creature thrown into the ring is compacted down to a thin layer of degenerate matter coating the sphere."
