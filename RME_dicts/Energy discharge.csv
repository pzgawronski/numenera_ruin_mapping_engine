1,"Blue electricity grants those exposed +1 to Speed Edge for one hour, but repeated exposure causes a runaway reaction that inflicts 3 points of Speed damage each round until the victim succeeds on a Might defense task."
3,"Gravity discharge pulses every few rounds, dramatically increasing gravity, which inflicts 6 points of ambient damage on a failed Might defense task."
5,Gravity drops to nothing every few rounds.
7,"Gravity discharge pulses every few rounds, dramatically increasing gravity, which inflicts 6 points of ambient damage on a failed Might defense task, but a defunct dark fathom is the source; reactivating the dark fathom is a level 6 Intellect task."
9,Random green electrical flares create voice-like sounds of an entity that is probably hopelessly insane.
11,White-hot plasma discharge inflicts 10 points of damage to those in its path.
13,"Warm red plasma discharge restores 6 points to a character's Pools, but each repeated exposure causes the character to descend one step on the damage track."
15,Pulsed light dazes victims for one round.
17,"Pulsed light gives those exposed one random piece of knowledge; more than three exposures per day risks a stroke, which inflicts 5 points of Intellect damage and moves victim one step down the damage track."
19,Pulsed light programs victim who fails an Intellect defense task into believing they are on a secret mission to deliver a message to a creature* in another part of the ruin.
21,Pulsed light programs victim who fails an Intellect defense task into believing their allies are evil invaders and should be destroyed; effect lasts for one minute.
23,Pulsed light erases victim's memory of previous 28 hours on failed Intellect defense task.
25,Pulsed light provides those exposed with 5 points to add to their Intellect Pool; each point over their maximum requires an Intellect defense task to avoid a stroke and descending one step on the damage track.
27,"Pulsed light reprograms cyphers, automatons, artifacts, and other tech to assemble to create a new level 6 automaton that is erratic and potentially dangerous, though it could become an ally."
29,"Purple electricity gives creature a static charge that can be discharged as part of a melee attack to inflict +4 points of damage; additional charges can be built up, but doing so requires an Intellect defense task to avoid a stroke and descending two steps on the damage track."
31,Incandescent plasma sears strange symbols and equations on exposed creature's skin and face.
33,"Orange electricity supercharges a creature's carried cyphers and artifacts, increasing their level by 3. A repeated exposure causes charged cyphers to explode as if detonations of their new higher level."
35,Grey plasma forms aura-like nimbus around exposed creatures that persists for several days.
37,Turquoise plasma causes mundane equipment and clothing to melt into goo; important equipment resists on a successful Speed defense task by owner.
39,Psychic flare from an exposed conduit inflicts 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) each round on creatures within immediate range.
41,Psychic flare from an exposed conduit gives a random phobia to creatures within immediate range.
43,"Large device with many conduits sparks and snaps with electrical discharge, but the discharge is directed into a point on the ceiling, rendering the device relatively safe to approach, despite appearances."
45,"Kinetic energy leaks from exposed conduit as red electricity, transferring to creatures within immediate range, potentially hurling them a short range in a random direction and inflicting 5 points of damage."
47,"Kinetic energy leaks from exposed conduit as red electricity, which gives creatures +3 to Speed Edge for one hour. Additional exposures inflict Speed damage instead of conferring Edge."
49,"Chronal energy leaks from cracked device, slowing exposed creatures to a state of stopped time, so that no time passes for them, while many minutes or hours pass externally."
51,"Chronal energy leaks from cracked device, causing exposed creatures to begin to skip several seconds forward in time."
53,"Chronal energy leaks from cracked device, causing exposed creatures to move more slowly through time. Their voices are noticeably lowered, and the difficulty of their Speed-based tasks is increased by one step when dealing with non-slowed creatures. The effect lasts for several hours."
55,"Chronal energy leaks from cracked device, causing exposed creatures to move more quickly through time. Their voices are noticeably higher in pitch, and the difficulty of their Speed-based tasks is decreased by one step when dealing with creatures not in the same state. The effect lasts for a few minutes."
57,"Chronal energy leaks from cracked device, causing exposed creatures to race through time. Their voices are a shrill whine that can’t be understood by those not in the same state, they can take two actions instead of one on their turn, and the difficulty of their Speed-based tasks is reduced by one step when dealing with creatures not in the same state. The effect lasts for a few minutes."
59,"Device on mount holds a tiny point of fierce light within a force field; however, an occasional warp in that field allows bursts of invisible accelerated particles to blast into the area and nearby areas, scorching objects and creatures in wavering lines of energy. Symbols in an unknown language, if they can be translated, read “solar wind tap.”"
61,"Magnetic energy leaks from a milky complex of spheres and rods, visible as a pinkish shimmer that randomly magnetizes a creature's metallic possessions. Magnetized possessions are attracted to each other, repelled apart, or both."
63,"Magnetic energy pulses from a milky complex of spheres and rods, visible as red pulses of light that create such intense reactions that the tiny bits of iron in a creature's blood become magnetized, repelling one another in a way that risks causing the creature to detonate. On a failed Might defense task, an affected creature descends one step on the damage track and takes 10 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor)."
65,The surrounding area is oddly quiet as sound is stripped away and stored in a silvery device thick with metallic prongs. A malfunction in the device sometimes releases the stored energy in sonic crescendos of white noise that can deafen nearby creatures.
67,"As 65-66; in addition, the sound energy reacts to one or more nearby cyphers, which might cause them to activate, or could reprogram them to take on a different function than previously determined."
69,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inciting discord among creatures in the area, potentially causing armed conflict among those who fail an Intellect defense task."
71,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of contentment and joy among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail an Intellect defense task so satisfied that they slump down and refuse to continue their exploration."
73,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of fear among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail an Intellect defense task so terrified that they freeze in horror."
75,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of trust among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail an Intellect defense task so credulous that they are not ready to defend themselves from actual threats."
77,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of trust among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail an Intellect defense task so credulous that they are not ready to defend themselves from actual threats; however, the leaking trust causes creatures* in the area that would normally be aggressive to welcome explorers as long-lost allies and friends."
79,"Clear synth module filled with thousands of tiny flashing entities, normally too small to be seen by the naked eye, in a saline gel. The module is cracked, and the gel has spread into one or more nearby areas. Contact with the gel (and the tiny creatures in it) causes electrical damage to exposed flesh, but might repower used cyphers."
81,"Clear synth module filled with thousands of tiny flashing entities, normally too small to be seen by the naked eye, in a saline gel. The module is cracked, and the gel has spread into one or more nearby areas. Contact with the gel (and the tiny creatures in it) causes electrical damage to exposed flesh, but might repower used cyphers, but instead of emitting light, the entities absorb light and energy, creating a reverse sparkle in the leaking gel. Contact with the gel drains Might (ignores Armor) and could also drain a cypher, rendering it useless."
83,"Concentrated ion leaks from a crystalline and synth device, causing a howling, moaning sound to reverberate through nearby areas, along with a slight breeze. A fierce wind emanating from the device at its source makes it difficult to approach directly."
85,"Concentrated ion leaks from a crystalline and synth device, causing a howling, moaning sound to reverberate through nearby areas, along with a slight breeze. A fierce wind emanating from the device at its source makes it difficult to approach directly; however, a few successful Intellect tasks could allow someone to find the leak and turn it off. But a mistake causes the entire chamber to be launched from the structure like a rocket, which could be lethal if navigation systems or other means of steering can't be found before the chamber crashes back to earth."
87,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of agony among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail a Might defense task fall into writhing heaps."
89,"Psychic energy leaks from exposed conduits, inducing feelings of ecstasy among creatures in the area, potentially making those who fail a Might defense task fall into trembling heaps."
91,"Transdimensional energy swirls and flows through the area, sometimes condensing into objects that were not there earlier, or causing equipment of creatures in the area to randomly disappear."
93,"Temporal energy swirls and flows through the area, which has a chance to transport creatures who enter the area to the location of their birth."
95,"A device spits sonic energy through the area, which sometimes triggers changes through rapid nanite construction in flesh. Creatures that fail a Might task are replaced with silent versions of themselves called whispers over the next 10 + 1d6 hours."
97,Haze of brownish gas escapes from reservoir; the gas is a “flavored ion” that induces the sense of eating a very satisfying sugary treat in creatures that come into contact with it.
99,"Massive cracked canister has leaked electric algae, which crusts all surfaces in the area and has advanced into some of the areas beyond. The growth has achieved sentience and can telepathically speak with those who are sensitive enough to hear it. The algae can electrify itself to gather fertilizer in the form of living creatures, or to defend itself from grazing."
